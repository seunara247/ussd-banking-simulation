# USSD Banking Simulation in Python
This project is a beginner-friendly simulation of a USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) banking system using Python. It mimics the basic functionality a user might encounter when dialing a banking shortcode on their mobile device.

## Overview
The application presents a text-based interface where users can:

- Buy airtime or data

- Pay utility bills

- Transfer funds

- Check account balance

- Exit the system

It includes basic validation such as:

- PIN confirmation

- Phone number/account number checks

- Sufficient balance verification

## Project Structure

ussd.py is the main Python script that runs the USSD simulation.

## What I Learned

- Through this project, I learned:

- How to use input() to collect user data

- Conditional logic with if, elif, and else

- String and number validation techniques (e.g., checking number length, using isdigit())

- The use of variables to simulate real-life banking elements like PIN and balance

- How to simulate nested menu structures like a real USSD interface

- Basic debugging and code flow design for user interactions

## How to Run

- Make sure Python is installed on your system.

- Clone this repository or download the ussd.py file.

- Run the script using: python ussd.py

### Notes

- This simulation is for learning purposes only and does not interact with any real banking system.

- A flat rate of â‚¦6.98 is displayed at the beginning, similar to real-world USSD charges in Nigeria.
